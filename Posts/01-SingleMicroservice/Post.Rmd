# Introduction
We're going to develop a simulation of a single microservice using [simmer](https://r-simmer.org/). The purpose is two fold:

1. I want to learn more about using simmer
2. I want to build towards a model that incorporates Bayesian statistics and discrete event simulation to understand the behavior of microservice based systems

## simmer
I want to have a simulation where I can generate events (API requests) using arbitrary size and arrival time distributions while getting information about queue times and load. In looking for a software package that helps me with this simulation work, I had a few additional requirements:

1. I wanted something that integrates with R or Python because this whole project is developed in Posit Cloud
2. I need it to be somewhat performant because we will simulate large systems
3. Has to handle arbitrary size and arrival time distributions because API requests are anything but normal

Originally, I was going to use [SimPy](https://simpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) since it meets my requirements. However, at the time of this writing the Python support in Posit Cloud is in beta. So I kept looking until I found [simmer](https://r-simmer.org/), a discrete event simulation package for R. So let's give it a go and learn how to use it together.

## Ultimate modeling aim
The goal of this article is to start down a journey of simulating microservice performance and reliability by combining realistic workloads with first principles based simulations. We will start with one simple microservice (this article) and gradually build up a system of interacting services. We can then explore what controls performance and reliability as well as learning how to improve our design by incorporating resiliency patterns.

# Defining terms for our simulation
1. Event - this is a single API request to the service to perform a discrete unit of work
2. Service - an entity that takes Events and processes them consisting of a Compute layer and a Data Storage layer
3. Resource - a concept in simmer used to represent the individual layers of each Service

# Setup for simmer
## Installation
Installing simmer is quite easy and instructions can be found [here](https://r-simmer.org/#installation)

## Setup
To get started we will need to tell R to load simmer, set a random number generator seed, and start a simmer environment.

```{r}
library(simmer)

set.seed(42)

env <- simmer("OneMicroService")
env
```

# Writing our simulation
## Trajectory for our service
Simmer defines actions/paths as trajectories. Our microservice will need a corresponding trajectory that encapsulates the compute layer and the data layer. Since we're treating each component as a resource we will need to seize it, wait, and then release it. Here we call our compute layer 'app' and the data layer 'database'.
```{r}
request <- trajectory("request path") %>%
  ## add a api hosting app
  seize("app", 1) %>%
  timeout(function() rnorm(1, 10)) %>%
  release("app", 1) %>%
  ## add a backing database
  seize("database", 1) %>%
  timeout(function() rnorm(1, 5)) %>%
  release("database", 1)
```

If you're wondering about the timeout statement it just uses rnorm to generate the timeout value with mean 10 or 5 for the app and database resource, respectively. The standard deviation is not specified and defaults to 1. For more details about rnorm see [this helpful page](https://www.scaler.com/topics/r-rnorm/)

## Adding resources and generators
```{r}
env %>%
  add_resource("app", 1) %>%
  add_resource("database", 2) %>%
  add_generator("request", request, function() rnorm(1, 10, 2))

env %>% run(until = 400)

env %>% get_mon_arrivals() %>%
  transform(waiting_time = end_time - start_time - activity_time)
```

# Computing Environment
