# Introduction
In the last post we simulated one microservice and saw a strange behavior. In our high load simulation we saw that requests were taking significantly longer to complete. To understand this behavior, I want to run a bunch of simulations while varying the time between requests.

# A quick recap
Let's quickly look at the simulation code from last time:
```{r echo=TRUE, results='hide', message=FALSE}
library(simmer)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
set.seed(42)

env <- simmer("OneMicroService")

request <- trajectory("request path") %>%
  ## add a api hosting app
  seize("app", 1) %>%
  timeout(function() rnorm(1, 10)) %>%
  release("app", 1) %>%
  ## add a backing database
  seize("database", 1) %>%
  timeout(function() rnorm(1, 5)) %>%
  release("database", 1)

env %>%
  add_resource("app", capacity=1, queue_size = 20) %>%
  add_resource("database", capacity=1, queue_size = 20) %>%
  add_generator("request", request, function() rnorm(1, 10, 2))

env %>% run(until = 4000)

env %>%
  get_mon_arrivals %>%
  ggplot(aes(end_time - start_time)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  xlab("Request duration") +
  ylab("Number of requests")
```

From the graph we can see that while most requests finish in the expected amount of time, there are many that take 2-4x longer than they should.
